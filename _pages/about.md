Welcome! I’m Taoyi Qi, a Ph.D. candidate at the State Key Laboratory of Internet of Things for Smart City, University of Macau, working under the guidance of Prof. Yonghua Song and Prof. Hongxun Hui.  

My research lies at the intersection of energy systems, climate goals, and smart city technologies. I am passionate about building low-carbon, resilient, and intelligent energy solutions that can help cities transition toward a sustainable future.

Previously, I completed my B.E. and M.E. degrees in Electrical Engineering at Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China (2020 and 2023), supervised by Prof. Yi Ding and Prof. Chengjin Ye.
